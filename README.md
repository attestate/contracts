# Contracts

## Motivation

In Optimism's retro funding round 4, participants needed to list all contracts of their project to claim their onchain impact measured through the KPIs of Open Source Observer.
In the process of applying, and since we often upgrade our contracts by simply deploying an entirely new version, we forgot a lot of contract addresses during the retro funding 4 process, which is why we now collect them in this repository.

## Criteria

These are all contracts we have deployed ourselves, not ones we use adjacently (like the Zora-deployed Kiwi Pass contract).

## Method

We use [ERC-3770](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3770) for our address specification format.
